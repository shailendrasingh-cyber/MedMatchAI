# MedMatchAI

MedMatchAI is an AI-driven project designed to match medical conditions to symptoms by using advanced sentence embeddings. The project uses the `SentenceTransformer` model to process and match input symptoms to the most likely condition, providing treatment recommendations based on the dataset.

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to match symptoms to medical conditions using precomputed symptom embeddings. Users can input their symptoms, and the application will return the most probable condition along with its recommended treatments.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing the dataset.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For generating sentence embeddings for symptoms.
- **Flask**: For creating the web application (if applicable).
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading model objects and data.
